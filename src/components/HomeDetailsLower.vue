            In addition to quality service, Taylor Law Office is dedicated to providing such 
            representation at a reasonable price. Not only are our rates 
            reduced as compared to other firms, andy many of the costs and expenses associated with 
            legal representation are not forced upon the client. Among other expenses, this includes 
            costs for electronic legal research.

            Finally, it is the client that is placed at the forefront of all decisions at Taylor 
            Law Office. From the outset of all cases, our attorneys meet with all clients and 
            discuss the process involved with civil litigation. This most-basic step develops a 
            bond with the client that fosters trust and strengthens defenses. In fact, on multiple 
            occasions, insureds defended by Taylor Law Office attorneys have returned for other 
            legal needs when issues arise.
