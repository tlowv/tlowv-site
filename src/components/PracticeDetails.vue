                            Insurance defense in West Virginia is both complex and precarious. 
                            Moreover, the legal environment in West Virginia can present serious 
                            challenges to insurers operating in our state. For over a decade, 
                            the attorneys at Taylor Law Office have successfully assisted West 
                            Virginia insurers meet those challenges. For instance, Taylor Law 
                            Office is often used for resolving minor issues that insurers confront 
                            daily. By conducting examinations under oath and obtaining sworn statements, 
                            Taylor Law Office is frequently utilized to determine what defenses or 
                            coverages are potentially applicable based upon the facts of a particular 
                            case. We are regularly used to file for court approval of minor settlements, 
                            settlements in wrongful death actions, and for judicial disbursement of insurance proceeds.

                            In addition to assisting with the smaller matters that frequently arise for insurers, 
                            Taylor Law Office handles all types of major litigation. We routinely litigate cases 
                            involving auto-accidents, claims of premises liability, and construction defect claims. 
                            Taylor Law Office represents some of the largest convenience store chains and businesses 
                            in West Virginia. Our office has extensive experience with workplace accident cases 
                            involving West Virginia's statutory employer immunity provisions for "deliberate intent."

                            In West Virginia, as is the case throughout the United States, 
                            employers are expected to provide an employee with a safe working 
                            environment. When that standard is not satisfied, employees 
                            unfortunately can be wrongfully injured. While most work-place 
                            accidents are rightly handled by the West Virginia workers compensation 
                            system, there are instances when additional steps against the employer are 
                            justified.
