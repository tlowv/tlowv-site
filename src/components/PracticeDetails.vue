                            In West Virginia, as is the case throughout the United States, 
                            employers are expected to provide an employee with a safe working

                            unfortunately can be wrongfully injured. While most work-place

                            system, there are instances when additional claims against the employer are 
                            justified.

                            While the law for premises liability claims are governed by the open, obvious, and reasonable
                            apparent standard, claims against homeownders and commercial enterprises routinely are defended by
                            Taylor Law Office.  Additionally, Taylor Law Office has extensive experience with dog bite defense.
