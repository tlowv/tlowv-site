            Exceptional service at a reasonable rate with the client's interest always placed first. 
            Taylor Law Office is committed to this simple principle. In practice, this principle 
            is exhibited in numerous ways. First, we aggressively defend all cases by tirelessly 
            investigating and thoroughly developing all viable arguments in our client's favor. 
            Through discovery, whether written or depositions, our attorneys pursue all angles to 
            defend our clients. By approaching all cases in this manner, should the case go to trial, 
            our attorneys are prepared to make the absolute strongest arguments.

            In addition to quality service, Taylor Law Office is dedicated to providing such 
            representation at a reasonable price. Not only are Taylor Law Office's hourly rates 
            reduced as compared to other firms, but most of the costs and expenses associated with 
            legal representation are not forced upon the insurer. Among other things, this includes 
            costs for electronic legal research.

            Finally, it is the client that is placed at the forefront of all decisions at Taylor 
            Law Office. From the outset of all cases, our attorneys meet with all clients and 
            discuss the process involved with civil litigation. This most-basic step develops a 
            bond with the client that fosters trust and strengthens defenses. In fact, on multiple 
            occasions, insureds defended by Taylor Law Office attorneys have returned for other 
            legal needs when issues arise.
