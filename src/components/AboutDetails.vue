                    We handle the basic auto-accident case every day. Additionally, we
                    handle commercial claims for premises liability and construction defects. We also
                    handle complex litigation involving first-party claims against insurers for extra-
                    contractual liability, bad faith, and statutory violations of the West Virginia Unfair Trade
                    Practices Act. We have represented insurers in court and before the West Virginia
                    Insurance Commissioner. We are routinely retained to assist with multi-million-dollar
                    claims involving death, serious injury, and extreme damages. Taylor Law Office is routinely retained
                    by the largest convenience store franchise in West Virginia (Go Mart) and has 
                    handled dozens of serious cases prior to and after suit is filed. In
                    addition, we serve as coverage counsel and coverage cases continually make up a
                    sizeable amount of work for the office. Our office also handles property damage claims
                    (water, fire, wind, etc.) against various insurers and we conduct multiple examinsations under oath
                    every year.
